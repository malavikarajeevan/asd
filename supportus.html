          <h4>In 2019, Thinkful was acquired by Chegg. Chegg was nothing but supportive, and continued funding us the<br> entire time. However we began to feel that it might be in our best interest to become self-funding, to avoid<br> the risk of being acquired by a company that might not be as supportive.</h4>
